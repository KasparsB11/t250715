# Test Plan

- Test for if counter text is present.
- Test if counter is present.
- Test if buttons are present (in some cases with specific names).
- Test if buttons work by advancing and reducing the counter.
- Test edge case when counter is zero and decrease button is clicked — counter should stay zero and not decrease.
- Test edge case when counter is above zero and decrease button is clicked until zero is reached — counter should stay zero and not decrease.
- Set up report generation on Github.</br>
<sup>p.s. in real applications some text needs to have exact wording, and tests may have to support different languages</sup>
